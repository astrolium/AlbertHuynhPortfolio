                    <p className="about--me--description">As a kid, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but from a young age, I was always interested in technology, and it all started with the iPod Touch. I loved how it made life easier; information was accessible at the palm of my hand. As I grew a bit older, I got curious how people made something so complex yet so intuitive. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="about--me--description">In high school, I reached out and talked to people in tech and stumbled on Product Management. I heard stories of Product Managers impacting millions of people with projects they'd work on. Ever since coming to the University of Waterloo, I've been able to be a part of product teams in a few organizations and understand what went on behind closed doors.
